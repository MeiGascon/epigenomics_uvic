- Move to folder ATAC-seq, and create folders to store bigBed data files and peaks analyses files. Make sure the files are organized in a consistent way as done for ChIP-seq.

- Retrieve from a newly generated metadata file ATAC-seq peaks (bigBed narrow, pseudoreplicated peaks, assembly GRCh38) for stomach and sigmoid_colon for the same donor used in the previous sections. Make sure your md5sum values coincide with the ones provided by ENCODE.

- For each tissue, run an intersection analysis using BEDTools: report 1) the number of peaks that intersect promoter regions, 2) the number of peaks that fall outside gene coordinates (whole gene body, not just the promoter regions).

Since I only want ATAC-seq in stomach and ATAC-seq in sigmoid colon, I filtered metadata.tsv file. Otherwise, I could choose in Assay title ATAC-seq (the best correct way).

***Note: There is a considerable number of files associated with a given experiment (fastq, bam, bigBed, bigWig). For a matter of space limit, it's always convenient to download only the files that we need, and avoid storing for a long time material that we could easily re-download. To do so, we can rely on the metadata file provided by ENCODE. The metadata file contains information about all the files related to the selected experiment.

***Note: In this context, $1 represents the first column from the md5sum that I am generating, while filename and original_md5sum are those from ENCODE. Therefore, in the tmp file, I have the filename (from ENCODE), the md5sum (from ENCODE), and the md5sum (the one I calculated).

#2. The number of peaks that fall outside gene coordinates (whole gene body, not just the promoter regions). The exercise now requires us to examine the peaks that do not overlap with any gene regions. We already have the library gene annotation from ChIP-seq, so we simply copy it to ATAC-seq.

cp annotation/gencode.v24.protein.coding.gene.body.bed ../../ATAC-seq/annotation/ 

***Note: In BED files, the start coordinates are 0-based and the end coordinates are 1-based. This means that the first base of a chromosome is base 0, but the end of an interval is exclusive, that is, the end base is not included in the interval. Therefore, when you convert from a GTF file (1-based start, 1-based end) to a BED file (0-based start, 1-based end), you only need to subtract 1 from the start coordinate. The end coordinate remains the same.
